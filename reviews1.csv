"We cannot recommend JD Cars enough! Dale went above and beyond to help us find our perfect family car. After finding the car on their easy to navigate website, we then messaged and received very quick responses to our questions. When we went to see it, although a second hand five-year-old car, the care and attention to detail meant it really does feel like a brand new car.  They gave a good deal on the car and warranty; we couldn‚Äôt be happier. We will definitely be recommending their services to anyone we know."
"Excellent service, car is perfect. Would definitely recommend and come back againüëè"
"I want to say that is a useful service which very helped me one time. So, I will recommend it to all my friends because it is so lit"
"Went with my son to buy him a car and spoke with Dale. He was professional and helpful. I normally hate buying cars but it was a relaxed environment and it was clear that Dale was interested in finding my son the right car and making sure we were satisfied rather than just selling us anything. The car (Ford Focus) is brilliant, runs like a dream and no issues. Can‚Äôt recommend this company enough üëçüèª"
"Amazing customer service, very friendly and welcoming- nothing was too much trouble. I absolutely love my car, it‚Äôs never let me down and was like brand new even though it was 5 years old.

"Brilliant service. Told them exactly what we wanted and they found our new car for us straight away. Customer service was that good, we went back for a second car for the sister in-law. No fuss, no extra costs. If any body I know wants a car, I'll refer them to these guys."
